# CSCI297-mailing-list-subscription-opee2012

This program outputs a textbox where the user enters in their email to subscribe for a mailing list. The user then receives an email where they click on a link to confirm their email. They are then redirected to a page that lets them know the email is confirmed. At that point, they receive another email thanking them for the subscription.

Instructions:

Start the server using `php -S localhost:8080` from the root of the repo.  Use your browser to goto [http://localhost:8080/subscribe.php](http://localhost:8080/subscribe.php)
